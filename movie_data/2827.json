Global warming has melted much of the polar ice caps, resulting in serious flooding around the world - including the city of London, which is now under several feet of water. In the ensuing chaos, a new killer has emerged. One that's unnatural, unrelenting and unstoppable. Maverick veteran policeman Harley Stone (Rutger Hauer) has a link with the killer - it murdered his partner, and he will do whatever it takes to bring down the killer. As a new rookie is assigned to him, Stone must find the killer, rescue his girlfriend, and fight off his own inner demons as he gets closer to his mysterious adversary.
