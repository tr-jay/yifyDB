Shani and her family are among the last elephants on earth to make these lengthy migrations. She's mother to wide-eyed, one-year-old Jomo, who has yet to experience a migration, and at 40 years old, she is next in line as herd matriarch, a position currently held by her older sister Gaia. Gaia's herd is among countless species - from hippopotamus to lechwe to baboons - that rely upon the life-giving water that flows from the mountains and transforms the heart of the desert into a green oasis known as the Okavango delta. But the season's end is near and soon there will be a mass exodus. Nothing on Earth is more precious to life than water.
