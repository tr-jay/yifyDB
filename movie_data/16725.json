Calvin, her seventeen-year-old neighbor, who uses a wheelchair after an accident, also cannot get used to his new position. A fleeting conversation between two people, for various reasons forced to spend a lot of time at home, gives rise to a tender friendship in which both find what they lacked. Kelly, once a punk-rocker turned suburban mom, is nostalgic for a life she can no longer have and uncertain of a future she doesn't yet fit in. Seventeen-year-old Cal is frustrated at his lack of control over the hand he's been dealt. When the two strike up an unlikely friendship, it's the perfect spark needed to thrust them both back to life.", "description_full": "Kelly once played in a punk band, and now, after the birth of her son and moving to a cozy and boring suburb, she can not feel comfortable in the role of the right mom and exemplary wife.
