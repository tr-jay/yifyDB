Expecting some potential benefits from the inheritance Jane makes her way to her grandmother's remote estate, Hobbes House, to attend the reading of the will. When Jane arrives at the estate she finds herself face to face with her estranged but successful half-sister Jennifer Dormant, who has brought along her lover Nigel Thatcher, an investment banker from London. The only other people attending are Eurydice Saul, the solicitor and Naser Mohammedin, a Syrian refugee, who worked as the groundskeeper for Jane and Jennifer's late grandmother. The reading of the will gets harshly interrupted when Saul is killed in a gruesome accident. When a storm cuts off the estate from the outside world, Jane is attacked by the reanimated corpse of Saul.
