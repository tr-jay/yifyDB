When his high-school senior prank goes wrong, his life crumbles before his eyes. In frustration he launches the F**k-It List - of all the things he wishes he'd done but was too afraid. The list goes viral and touches a nerve with teenagers everywhere, exposing the educational-industrial complex as a money-machine designed to encourage anxiety-ridden parents to sell their kids into years of Tiger-Mom style servitude.
