He has a wife Masako (Naoko Otani), and a young son Taro. Kato also has a friend Yamazaki (Akira Emoto) who he knew since college.

She has some deep rooted distrust for men in general. One day, Katoh comes home when Masako and Yamazaki is having an affair.

Their lives are changed and starts to roll down hill. The focus of the movie is the nude scenes by Otani and Ishida, as the movie was made to have sexual contents. Otani and Ishida were popular at the time as being sexy actresses. Interesting movie to watch even as a cultural piece from the '80s Japan. You get to see how people's lives were back then.
