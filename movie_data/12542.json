Isabelle is forced to confront the fact that she is aging out of what George wants in a playmate and spouse, and knows that the only way to hold onto her relationship is to become the alpha in the relationship. But George fights back, forcing them into a game of one-oneupmanship. Eventually the trio - Isabelle, Cecile and the ship's Captain - join forces against George, making their position clear.
