It's a friendship that's blind to differences in social backgrounds and character. Given incredible access, S\u00e9bastien Lifshitz painstakingly filmed Emma and Ana\u00efs' transformation over the years, during a period when their physical, emotional and intellectual development is dramatic. We first meet them aged 13, their lives are dominated by boys, teachers and arguing with their mums. But as we witness them near adulthood, their journey is both fascinating and surprisingly moving. At the same time, the influence of their environment and family circumstances becomes increasingly apparent. New experiences, everyday conversations and events both personal and political anchor the film, creating a uniquely textured and deeply personal portrait of two young French women.", "description_full": "Born in a small, provincial French town, Ana\u00efs and Emma have been best friends since childhood.
