But, amid a sea of jugglers, sideshow performers, streetwalkers, and crooks, the silently eloquent mime, Baptiste, comes to her rescue, only to hopelessly fall for her. And just like that, love's sweet torture befalls the delicate pantomimist, as the insufferable burden of knowing that the object of his desire can never belong to anyone, will heartlessly haunt him for years to come. Many have tried to seize her heart--the flamboyant thespian, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Lema\u00eetre; the criminal dandy, Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Lacenaire, and the imperious but loveless Count, \u00c9douard de Montray--however, Garance, after so many barren years, now seems to need only one man.
