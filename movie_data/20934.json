He despises the man who raised him, who is not his real father, and runs away from home, taking refuge with a friend, Olivier. Olivier is a shy boy, lacking affection, which he tries to find with his Uncle Edouard. The attraction between the two is mutual although neither manages to express his feelings. Through a combination of circumstances, Bernard is hired by Edouard as his secretary, and they both leave for a stay in the mountains.
