His parents have died, but his two brothers -- Ezra, The Matriarch (Robert Longstreet) and Amos, The Artist (Onur Tukel) -- have continued their isolated, idiosyncratic lives on the family farm. The brothers receive the phenomenally bearded Cornelius' return with equal parts bewilderment and joy, but he remains a mysterious presence in their midst, slipping away occasionally to hustle cash as an unlikely ringer on the basketball and tennis courts. A tentative balance is struck, even as much remains unsettled and unsaid among the brothers... until a sleazy figure from their past returns, turning their world on its head.
