When this premonition becomes reality, Luke must deal with the trials and tribulations of being dubbed \"The Prophet of Death\" and being titled a freak by the entire town. It doesn't help that he's fallen in love with Faith (List) who just happens to be Stan's girl or that he's on the outs with his childhood best friend Fang (Grayson Gabriel) or that the premonitions just keep coming - In a story that expertly navigates that often rocky, at times inspiring road to adulthood, Anthem authentically balances the teenage experience of confusion, anxiety and rage with those exceptional moments of clarity, self discovery and human connection. Hormonal, funny, exhilarating and wise, Anthem slyly explores the need to belong, the isolation of youth and the powerful brew of fear truth and noise that plays inside us all.", "description_full": "Anthem tells the story of Luke (Monaghan) a teenager who foresees the death of his new best friend Stan (MacNicoll), the most popular guy in school.
