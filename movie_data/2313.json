Street-wise and tough, an ex-marine, he is betrayed by a one-time partner, and shot in the back by his junkie wife.

He has to make his way through a world populated by heroin dealers, prostitutes, sado-masochists, gunmen and crooked cops, a place where torture is a way of life. His only friend is a former employer, a prostitute, and her loyalty is in question, given she now works for the Outfit.
