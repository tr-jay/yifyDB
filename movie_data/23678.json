The plot is about a young reporter who is assigned by his editor the story of a wife who has left her government official husband. This assignment ends up changing both of their lives significantly. As a social document, the movie does have some interest as it makes points about idealism and how the Japanese divorce laws at the time were totally skewed against the wife. But the movie does not work that well as a drama. The story itself is not particularly compelling and the two male lead characters are not very likable. The movie does have a very bizarre ending, which does add interest in a macabre way, but overall there is little reason to seek this movie out.", "description_full": "The Good Fairy is an early 1950's Japanese movie that looks at journalism and marriage.
