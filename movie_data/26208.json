When a raging storm traps Amy, her mysterious replacement (Nicole Kang, \"Batwoman\"), and the uneasy staff inside their small-town radio station, reality begins to fracture as they move further and further into the graveyard shift.The film draws inspiration from classic horror tales brought to life by Stephen King, \"The Twilight Zone\", and other forgotten late night horror anthology programs.
