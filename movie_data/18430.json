Amongst those listening is Air Marshal Hardie (Sir Michael Redgrave), who is due to fly to Tokyo the next day. Hardie initially dismisses the dream because he is scheduled to fly out in a Liberator, but as Hardie arrives at the airport, he discovers that the Liberator has developed mechanical problems and has been replaced by a Dakota.
