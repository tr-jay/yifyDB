Alice panics, foreseeing a life of prostitution for her daughter and decides she will impersonate Molly and take the exam herself. She narrowly avoids Ffion in a store where she is trying on teenage dresses but David reckons she still looks like a 30-year-old pretending to look 11 and so she goes for a dowdy, anonymous look when she enters the hall to sit the exam.
