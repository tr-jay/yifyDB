Lung Fei appears as the Japanese leader. After the fighting they tie Jesus to his cross. To be historically accurate, they add another man on his left and right. They are all killed by a firing squad. After the Japanese leave, Jesus rises from the dead. He also seems to be surprised by his resurrection. He rummages for valuables then takes off dragging his cross. The Japanese appear again and charge after him. Chang Yi saves Jesus.
