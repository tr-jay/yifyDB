The mayor's numskull son Clint is a nightmare, so everyone hopes Ben's son and formerly groomed successor Ben White can be convinced. She seeks him in the Big Apple, where he struggles to become an author but depends for his income on Uber taxi rides. Faking to be a client, she sort of wins his friendship during the long drive home.
