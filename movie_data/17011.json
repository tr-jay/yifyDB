The search for a nice place to live in a desirable location with reasonable rents, decent neighbors and soundproof walls is more of a challenge than it should be, so when Sarah lucks into a sweet one-bedroom at Asilo Del Mar Apartments, she think she's hit the jackpot. Situated on a quiet street in Los Angeles, it's got plenty of space, friendly tenants, group BBQs and even a cute neighbor next door. But this being L.A., all is not what it seems: loud noises start keeping her awake at night; her cat is missing; everyone seems to be a little too helpful and friendly, except for the weirdo, Lester. Soon, Sarah learns she didn't choose this apartment - it chose her.", "description_full": "We all have apartment horror stories: annoying roommates, asshole landlords, dilapidated buildings, among many more nightmare scenarios.
