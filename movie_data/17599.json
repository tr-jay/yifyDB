With nothing but partying and music on his mind, Jake is forced to take a hard look at himself and the ashes around him after life slowly falls apart. Jake's old flame, BECCA, suddenly reappears in his life after seeing her AGAIN at a local music show. Good girl Becca, never forgetting who Jake is, makes him work for it only to fall for him again. His mother, MIA, harbors a painful secret... the father Jake thought was dead is alive. To protect Jake from the pain of knowing what his father, BO, had become after a horrible accident, Mia thought it best if Jake believed Bo was dead. Jake then eventually has a \"random\" encounter with Bo on the street in a Nashville suburb that sets off a chain of events to bring Bo back into his life and hopefully reconciliation to the family.", "description_full": "\"Like a Country Song\" is a story about JAKE REESON, an up and coming country singer who has the whole world in his hands until his ego gets in the way.
