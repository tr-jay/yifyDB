There are only anti-heroes and self-assumed victims who do not hesitate a second to become perpetrators to take revenge on their own perpetrators: jealous, liars or possessive women, dangerously self-destructive; And men whose maximum value is opportunism. There is no trait of kindness here, only facets of selfishness. Considering the improbability of this happening (not only in Mexican cinema of that time but in cinema in general), La noche avanza has a spectacular and quirky freshness.In addition, the frenzy accelerates as the night advances. Quite a few scenes from the second half of this film could be considered even pre- tarantinescan. So far the best movie I've found of the so-called Mexican Noir and the second best of the director Roberto Gavald\u00f3n (after Macario, 1960).", "description_full": "In \"La noche avanza\" there are no good or decent characters.
