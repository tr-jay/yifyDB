Free at last after six long months of captivity, the adventurous girl accepts a lift from a middle-aged travelling lingerie salesman and begins to recount titillating stories about her equally sex-starved classmates, in the same vein as The Young Seducers (1971), and Blutjunge Verf\u00fchrerinnen 2 (1972). Before long, the driver learns all about the chance encounter of Bellamy, the daughter of a great pianist, with a soft-handed violin player; the intoxicating escapades of the sultry vineyard worker, Linda; the summer adventure of pretty Violet and a lumberjack, and of course, Nadia and her passion for mud-filled motocross riders.
