However this film falls on the side of a Wong Jing hack-job, which unfortunately is neither genuinely funny, and looked formulaic and tired.Louis Koo plays 009, or translated literally from its aural pronunciation, double-O Dog.

Despite star billing though, she disappears for almost half the movie, appearing mainly in the first and last acts only, and instead the focus on the problems of the relationship between Dog and Faithful, became second fiddle to that of Dog's peer Royal Tiger (Tong Dawei) and Princess Rainbow (Song Jia), where a competition sees many suitors come knocking on the door to want to obtain her hand in marriage.Wong Jing may be the king of raunchy if he wants to, but in this film he stays surprisingly muted, opting instead for safer, PG-rated gags.

I wasn't able to detect any huge narrative gaps or sudden quite cuts, though it could have boiled down to entire sections being removed.
