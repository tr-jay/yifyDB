The documentary details their experiences with an embattled VA - from botched surgeries to misdiagnoses to personnel shortfalls - and educates about the fundamental changes and reforms that are needed to ensure our veterans are taken care of in a way that honors their service. It asks viewers to reflect on serious and complex questions about what kind of care our veterans have earned after they hang up their uniforms and when, how, and where they receive that care. The Care They've Earned tells the stories of six veterans, but it highlights the struggles of finding adequate health care that all veterans face.
