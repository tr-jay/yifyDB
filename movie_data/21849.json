At the same time, Israeli agents are desperately looking to bring THE GERMAN DOCTOR to justice. Based on filmmaker Luc\u00eda Puenzo's (XXY) fifth novel, the story follows Josef Mengele, the \"Angel of Death,\" a German SS officer and a physician at the Auschwitz concentration camp, in the years he spent \"hiding\", along with many other Nazi's, in South America following his escape from Germany. Mengele was considered to be one of WWII's most heinous Nazi war criminals.", "description_full": "Patagonia, 1960.
