When Mac McDonald loses his son in an accident, the ensuing 17 years of bitterness and pain erode his love for his family and leave him angry with God - and just about everyone else. Mac's rage stonewalls his career in the police department and creates a combustible situation when he's partnered with Sam Wright, a rising star on the force who happens to be a part-time pastor and a loving family man. Can they somehow join forces to help each other when it's impossible for either of them to look past their differences--especially the most obvious one? Every day, we have the opportunity to rebuild relationships and heal deep wounds by extending and receiving God's grace. Offer THE GRACE CARD - and never underestimate the power of God's love.", "description_full": "Everything can change in an instant - and take a lifetime to unravel.
