But John has stunned both guards and inmates alike, by accepting Christ in a prison bible study. Upon his release, he is anxious to share his new faith with the outside world. However, looking more like a thug than a theologian, the outside world is terrified of him. His only allies are his meek and mild Christian mentor, Matt Garrett (Michael Sigler) and his no nonsense parole officer (Dean Cain).
