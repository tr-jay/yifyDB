He was a university professor until an air raid, when he left to become a writer and has to live in a hut. His mood has hardly changed, not by the change nor by time. Every year his students celebrate his birthday, issuing the question \"Mahda kai?\" (not yet?), just to hear Uehida-san's answer \"Madada yo!\" (No, not yet!), in a ritual of self affirmation, and desires of lasting forever. It's a very \"japanese\" film who portrays everyday life and customs in Japan.", "description_full": "This film tells the story of professor Uehida Hyakken-sama (1889-1971), in Gotemba, around the forties.
