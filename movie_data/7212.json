Having learned to content himself with his anonymity, when he doesn't put his hands together for dubious merchandise or ask softball questions, Eddie is looking for excuses to visit his secret crush, Judy: a mousy cashier at a small gas station on Melrose Avenue. Then, Eddie catches the eye of the famous late-night talk show host, Jayme Stillerman, and just like that, anonymous Krumble becomes an overnight sensation.
