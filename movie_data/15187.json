Despite his round head, Oblio has many friends. But an evil Count (Lennie Weinrib), jealous that Oblio is more popular than his own son (Buddy Foster), says that without a pointed head, Oblio is an outlaw. Along with his faithful dog Arrow, Oblio is exiled to the Pointless Forest. There, he has many fantastic experiences (including encounters with a three-headed man, giant bees, a tree in the leaf-selling business (Paul Frees), and a good-humored old rock (Bill Martin)). From his adventures, Oblio learns that it is not at all necessary to be pointed to have a point in life.
