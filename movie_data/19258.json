In 1989, he took an extended hiatus from his work to settle down and help raise a family. In 2006, Wayne decided to come out of retirement to continue his life's work, with Andrea now joining him in his craft. The grisly details of Wayne and Andrea's horrific crimes were captured by Wayne's video camera, a sick, twisted way to relive the experience again and again. Hundreds of hours of shocking footage shot over a period of several months have been edited into a feature length film, with cooperation from the victims' families.
