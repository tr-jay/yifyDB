Sexually assaulted in her locked-up home, Carla is having a hard time telling the difference between fact and fantasy; however, both the unseen assailant and the painful bruises in hard-to-reach parts of her body are very real. Now--as all attempts with psychotherapy failed, and the late-night paranormal attacks become increasingly violent--Carla has no other choice but to turn to a team of parapsychologists who offer, at least, hope for a resolution.
