Ribbit (Sean Astin) is a frog with an identity crisis. Unlike frogs, he hates hopping and has a strong aversion to water. Feeling like a misfit, he is full of questions about his life... and so together with his best friend, a flying squirrel, he embarks on a soul-searching journey in search of the truth and his rightful place in this world. Set amongst the breathtaking backdrop of the Amazon rainforest, they surge ahead in their quest for the answer to life's mysteries... encountering a zany variety of colorful characters, both friend and foe, along the way. Confusion reigns when Ribbit is accidently hypnotized. Is Ribbit a human Prince trapped in a frog's body by an evil curse... or is he merely a confused colorful denizen of the jungle?", "description_full": "A fantastic journey sometimes begins with one tiny little hop.
