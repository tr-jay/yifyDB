Unable to convince his friends to join him, Spookley does the right thing and sets off alone to find Mistletoe. While Spookley races against time, and an oncoming snowstorm, Mistletoe meets an oddly energetic raccoon named Leon who tricks him into adopting three precocious kittens named Scat, Scram and Shoo.
