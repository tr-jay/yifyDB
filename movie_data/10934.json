No one really hangs out with them except a dumb jock named Gavin, and the class nerd Jonathan, and poor Danielle is getting nowhere with the popular guy Drew, even after she and friends accidentally killed his last girlfriend. It's been a year, and Drew still ignores her - but he doesn't ignore the new foreign exchange student Katarina. Since Katarina can't take a hint, Danielle begins plotting her downfall.
