When he is asked by his newspaper \"The Chicago Chronicle\" to report on a train crash, he notices new reporter Sabrina Peterson. Brackett's complacency gets rudely shocked by Peterson's report for the rival \"Chicago Globe.\" What follows next is a mad race between the reporters who then cook up possible events that lead up to the crash. After an initial spate of mad reporting, both settle down to get the facts straight, which leads them to uncover opposing information. When each gets setup to be killed at the same place, they escape, and then agree to work together.
