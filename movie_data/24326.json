When trainee nurse Anna agrees to accompany her partner to see her ailing father at their country home, she worries her background will make her an outcast among the wealthy Redferne family. Upon arrival Anna begins to realize that she may have underplayed her problems, and that they may have more to do with ritual sacrifice than they do with societal differences. Starring Daniella Faircloth, Erin Leighton, Alex Pitcher, Karen Payne, Shaniece Williams and Tony Manders, Onus is a terrifying contemporary new horror about paranoia, class, fear and the dark secrets that lay within the very fabric of our society.", "description_full": "From writer/director Alex Secker and producer Marcus Starr, makers of the award winning Follow the Crows, comes Onus, a terrifying new folk-horror inspired by classics such as The Wicker Man, Rosemary's Baby and The Shining.
