In \"Stitch! - The Movie\", Stitch, Jumba, and Peakley are all living with Lilo and Nani. But no one knows that Jumba had secretly deactivated all 625 of his other experiments and brought them with him. The ex-captain Gantu, hired by Jumba's former partner, Dr. Jacques Von Hamsterveil, goes to find them, and captures Jumba to interrogate him into telling where they are. Now, Lilo and Stitch have to save Stitch's ohana from being used for chaos.
