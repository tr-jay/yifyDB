This film encompasses the menial insecurities of today's youth and different emotional scenarios. 'Respect' is one of the key aspects and Love Shagun reinforces the importance of respect for each other in a relation. But at the same time, Love Shagun gives a crucial message of giving 'space' to one another. The story is about a young man 'JD' who's at an important stage of his life - choosing a life partner.
