She went to drama school and her family have always thought of her as a born actress. But as she begins her career, she is overshadowed by her little sister Sam, who is spotted in a random casting before becoming a star. Helpless and penniless, Mona knocks on Sam's door to find refuge, and some support. Gradually, Mona becomes a great assistant to Sam, both when filming and at home. But the situation changes dramatically when shooting commences on a film that's likely to turn Sam into a big star. Under the auspices of Pygmalion-esque Paul Borsek, Sam may well find the role of her life. The unhealthy relationship linking the two sisters to the director will tip the fragile balance between them, and push Sam into the ultimate corner.", "description_full": "Mona has always dreamed of becoming an actress.
