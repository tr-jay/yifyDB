After a gruesome multiple murder, Dean McCallum, a seemingly good and decent man, walks into a cafe covered in blood. Brought in for questioning, detectives Jared Lamb and Reina Herrera begin a series of interrogations to determine if McCallum is a psychopath, serial killer or suffering from multiple personalities. Yet McCallum's increasingly bizarre and unsettling comments, his paranormal awareness of things unknowable to him, and disturbing peripheral occurrences, suggest there may be otherworldly influences. Now they must determine if McCallum could be possessed by demons, be the Devil himself, or if there is something even more shocking to consider.
