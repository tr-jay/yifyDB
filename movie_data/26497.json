It's based on true stories of children who've been kidnapped for the underground sex slave industry. Every day young women, aged 13 - 17, are kidnapped, beaten, rapped, drugged, and sold as sex slaves. Currently, up to 300,000 girls in America are at risk of sex trafficking. This is raw look into what they go thru and is not for the squeamish. The cast and crew are hoping that this movie will bring more awareness about sex trafficking in America. Our government spends 300 dollars fighting the \"war on drugs\" for every dollar it spends to keep our children safe.", "description_full": "A Parent's Worst Nightmare is a powerful story, based on multiple real life events.
