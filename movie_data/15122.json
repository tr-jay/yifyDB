During a text argument about whose life is easier, Ellie and Jack trigger an inexplicable real-life swap. As each tries to navigate the other's life, hilarity ensues when Ellie (as Jack) learns about brotherly bonding and hockey lingo, while Jack (as Ellie) has to decipher girl code and experiences a spa day.
