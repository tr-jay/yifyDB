Thinking Stan is disabled (it's just that he's sitting on his leg), Oliver takes pity on him and takes him home for a nice home-cooked meal.

After blowing up the kitchen, Oliver is helped by his next-door neighbor, Mrs. Gilbert... until the big-game hunting Mr. Gilbert comes home unexpectedly, carrying a shotgun.", "description_full": "It's 1938, but Stan doesn't know the war is over; he's still patrolling the trenches in France, and shoots down a French aviator.
