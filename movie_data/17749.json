When the money he is paid is stolen, he embarks on a rampage of revenge. Things go from bad to perverse as Benji must fight and fuck his way through father figures, hookers with no hearts, marauding men and the hopelessly lost. All singing, all-fighting - FLOST is a throwback to the crime films of yesteryear mixed with the music of Kevin Quain. Based on the writings of pulp-fiction writer Jed Ayres, FLOST is a mash up of film noir, musical drama and hard-hitting social injustice.
