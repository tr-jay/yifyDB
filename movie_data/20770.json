They live on an isolated Ohio farm during the pioneer days. He wants his son to be raised in the manner his wife would have wanted - with proper schooling, Bible study and proper manners. Rachel, an indentured servant, is sold to David. David then marries her in order that little Davey would have a mother to properly raise him. David shows no real affection towards Rachel since this is a marriage of convenience. This all changes when Jim, a friend of the family comes for a visit. During his stay, David sees that there is more to Rachel than just being a \"bonds woman\", especially when Jim takes a liking to her. This awakens new feelings in David for Rachel.", "description_full": "David Harvey is a widower with a young son, Davey. They live on an isolated Ohio farm during the pioneer days.
