Viewers will get a rare behind-the-scenes look at what it is like to work for CNN during one of the busiest times of the year. How do you hold up after months on the road, eating terrible food and flopping in motels. What happens when your candidate drops out - or were you secretly hoping it would happen? And what do you learn about America by spending every day in its small towns. This doc features unprecedented access to the campaign press corps revealing how we pick our presidents - and how the media really works.
