Kuhio or Kuhio Taisa in Japanese is a story based on a real life event that happened in Japan.A man claiming to be a colonel and a pilot in US navy's 6th fleet defrauds several women pretending that he will marry them. He is supposedly related to the royal family of England and monarchy of Hawaii - thus his last name is Kuhio (as in prince Jonah Kuhio). It turns out that nothing he says he is is true. He's actually a native Japanese, but goes around in a soldier's uniform when he meets his women.How women fall for such an obvious lie seems to be the point of this movie, and somewhat comical aspect of the story. There are three women he goes out in this movie, but only two of them are really falling for him. The other girl who works at a bar is an even match for him.Very strange story even for a movie, but is based on the actual event that happened around the time of '92 Gulf War. Masato Sakai plays the intriguing character of Capt. Kuhio.Interesting movie that's hard to classify as a comedy or a horror drama. Scary part is the way Kuhio works his women. His lies are so smooth, and no one thinks (except one) that anyone would go to this extent to con a person.We all like to believe in the goodness and honesty of others, but this movie gives a revealing look at a person who lives on the other side of the society.", "description_full": "Wonderful World of Capt.
