On a quest for absolution, Tommy finds himself on trial where his confession delves into his deepest memories, but these are found to be distorted by projections of fear, desire and shame. Tommy's elaborate self-delusion weighs heavily on his girlfriend Carolyn, whose experience as a woman is overshadowed by the effects of Tommy's maternal loss. Dream and reality blur as the characters from the courtroom infiltrate his memories, dragging him back to the courtroom in a closed loop of self-hatred and blame.
