Through the window of this transcendental artifact and its sacred origins, Father the Flame is a cinematic exploration of legacy, family and love. The film follows Lee Erck, a world-renowned pipe maker from far Northern Michigan, as he travels the globe to explore the nearly forgotten art of tobacco pipe making. Featuring a charming cast of characters-from the royal family of Danish pipe makers, to the Italian briar cutter known as the worlds greatest, to a fourth-generation Native American peace pipe maker- this story speaks to a slower pace of life, a luxury in our sped-up world. Beautiful and hypnotic, Father the Flame immerses the viewer in the cultural and spiritual significance of the tobacco pipe and what it can teach a modern generation about legacy and the things we leave behind.", "description_full": "For centuries, the tobacco pipe has been a symbol of contentment and contemplation.
