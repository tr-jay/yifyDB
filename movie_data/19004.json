When they arrive at the hospital, the distraught family members are told that Andrew has suffered severe head injuries, and that he may never fully recover. A highway patrol officer who witnessed the accident adds the chilling news that the driver who did this to Andrew was drunk. Months later, after Andrew has recovered and leaves the rehabilitation center, Terry begins her long and emotionally draining fight to make certain that the person responsible for this tragedy makes amends.
