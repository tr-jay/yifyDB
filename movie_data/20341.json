The image, taken by French photojournalist Alexandra Boulat, was part of an exhibit in Kosovo. Driven by the haunting image and the fact Boulat died soon after first seeing the photo, Bowden sets out to learn more about the story behind the photo by meeting those who knew Boulat best. His obsession leads him to Kosovo where he hires a war fixer to help find out what happened to the refugee boy.
