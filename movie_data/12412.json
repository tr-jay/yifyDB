The previous film's heroes Adam, Marfa Girl, Inez, Miguel, Donna, and Tomek, all of whom reprise their roles from the original. This time around we follow the group as they deal with a heart-breaking tragedy, one that only further fuels their disaffection, boredom, and desire to break free from their small-town lives. As is expected, the film is filled with sex, drugs, bad decisions, and characters that are hard to shake. Chief among them is the skater Adam, who has two children from two different women, a young Latino slacker who is inexplicably the town's resident sex symbol and apparently irresistible to women; Inez, his live-in lover; and \"Marfa Girl\", now the mother of a baby boy as the result of a brutal rape.", "description_full": "Like the previous movie, \"Marfa Girl (2012)\", this movie follows the lives of some young, down-and-out characters in the dusty town of Marfa, Texas.
