In the midst of a challenging season, Cody (Jared Miller) learns he's not the best pitcher...or the best teammate. Meanwhile, Cody's dad, John (Kirk Cameron), is losing to an unscrupulous lobbysit scheming to take over the family business. Both Cody and John think their only option is to fight their problems on their own. It's not until they learn to rely on friends, teammates, and - most importantly - their faith and family that they discover their battles can truly be won.
