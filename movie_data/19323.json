His wife and daughter appear in this Barcelona performance, and he himself appears as Monteverdi, the conductor. The playing is excellent, but the singing, unfortunately of his family members is not quite as beautiful as the competing versions. (There are several clips from this version on YouTube if you want to hear Montserrat's \"La Musica\" and make up your own mind.) We are blessed that there are so many DVDs of this fabulous work, and so many worldwide live productions to commemorate its 400th anniversary this year. This is a valid interpretation of this great opera, filmed in a beautiful opera house. I would recommend it in addition to others (such as Harnoncort's), but not instead of it. It is not perfect, but still quite excellent.", "description_full": "I am a big Jordi Savall fan, having heard him live on several occasions.
