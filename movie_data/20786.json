Rebecca has no desire to date despite efforts by her feisty neighbor, Olive, who has a love advice column called Call Me Cupid. When Olive is pressured by her editor to get with the times, she enlists Justin to help her answer a letter. Unbeknownst to Justin, she publishes his advice under the alter ego, Cupid's Proxy. Justin goes ballistic until Olive makes him a deal he can't refuse. When Call Me Cupid receives a letter from someone who can only be Justin's guitar teacher, Stewart, Justin springs into action.

When his plans come crashing down, Justin has to come clean to both his mother and Stewart.
