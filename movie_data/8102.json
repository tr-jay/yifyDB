Wendy longs to leave her group home and return to life with her sister's family and new baby girl. She is sure that in order to reunite with her family, all she needs to do is convince them of her newfound competence and abilities. As a lover of all things Star Trek, Wendy writes in her free time; so when she hears about a Star Trek screenplay competition, she seizes the opportunity to submit her 500-page script and prove her worth. However, her only problem: if she doesn't hand in her 500-page script to Paramount Pictures in person, she will miss the deadline.
