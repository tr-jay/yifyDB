Clips of them performing their most famous hits in huge concert venues are effectively interspersed with shots of the local culture and scenery of the various countries they toured. The energy of their fans is contagious. It also documents the great difficulty they had being the first rock and roll band to perform (for free) in Cuba for many decades.
