Faust's Pact with the devil has unleashed technology that threatens mankind and Dr Goodfellow, as the current CEO of the world's biggest Tech company, Winestone INC, races against a ticking clock to document what may be humanity's last remaining hours. The Last Faust is a multi-faceted exploration of what it is to be human, complex and rich in contemporary references. Besides The Pact with Mephisto, the film tells of Faust's tragic love story with 16 year old Gretchen and his blind passion for the mythological goddess Helena. As well as travelling through real and mythological worlds, The Last Faust also transcends time, as Dr Faust punctuates key German historical moments such as the advent of money printing, the Greek war, and the beginnings of the cynical materialism of the modern day Church.", "description_full": "Based on the tragic play by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, The Last Faust is told from the perspective of Faust's future successor Dr Goodfellow, played by TBC.
