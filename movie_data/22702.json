But he has emotionally withdrawn from her in the months following a tragic automobile accident in which their daughter was killed. His reticence troubles her, who seems helpless to do anything about it. Then one day her husband comes home a changed man -- romantic, affectionate, and eager to talk about hers possible transfer to New York City. There's only one problem: Edward is chained to a chair in a suburban basement, held hostage by gun-toting tough gal, Beth.
