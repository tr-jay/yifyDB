More than anything in the world, nine-year-old Ralphie Parker wants to get a powerful Red Ryder Lever Action BB gun for Christmas. Instead, Mother Parker gives him a warning, and to get his hands on the ultimate gift of the holiday season, Ralphie embarks on a mission to talk everyone into seeing things his way. Of course, all the vignettes, the lines, and the gags of the classic original, A Christmas Story (1983), show up, including the Old Man's leg-shaped lamp, the neighbourhood bullies, the flagpole incident, and the little dirty word.
