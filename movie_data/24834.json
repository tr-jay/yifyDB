But she soon learns that Galt has been deceiving her, and has no intentions of divorcing his wife. So she meets Pierre Clemont, a potter, and falls for him (onscreen and off). Into this little slice of life comes Emil Landosh, a confidence man, and he steals a bracelet that Galt had given Victor and uses it to pay a debt. Enter a twist-of-fate, and it ends up in Galt's hands. Strained credibility aside since many, many films depend on beating the coincidental odds, Galt assumes that Landosh is Victor's lover, and this isn't a good assumption on his part since Landosh kills him and then makes it appear as if Victor and Clermont did the deed.", "description_full": "Johnny Victor's in love with an international businessman, Louis Galt, who is actually the head of a syndicate which mints illegal coins for the Continental market.
