He asks a woman living there to use her phone because his car broke down. Friendly chatter quickly turns into a game of insinuations, implications and accusations. The two seem to know each other somehow and they are playing a bizarre mind game, where the woman gets points for finding holes in the stranger's story. The next day, they meet again in the nearby town and he gives her a lift to her house as their little game continues. It eventually becomes clear that he's suspecting her of murder of her husband, lover and daughter, which she vehemently denies. Who or what is he, why is he playing this game of accusations with this woman and where is her family or, for that matter, the neighbors or the townspeople? The revelations turn out to be shocking and the stakes of their odd game higher than imaginable.
