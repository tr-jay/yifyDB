They're the result of a seismic super weapon known as the Hell Storm device; and now that it's been activated, the shockwaves it sends out will destroy major cities across the globe, killing millions. When her claims fall on deaf ears, Kate teams up with her daughter and estranged husband at the San Andreas fault line to find a way to counteract the destruction. As Kate and her family navigate the fault, they find themselves directly at the epicenter of the largest shockwave yet.
