While driving in the lonely road, she talks to her sister Ella and decides to take a detour to visit the Grand Canyon.

Then she offers a ride to him and when she is driving, he says pornography to her. She asks him to leave but he shows a knife and tells her to go to a derelict motel. Mallory sees that the psychopath Christian is not wearing the seat bell and decides to throw the truck off the road in a curve.
