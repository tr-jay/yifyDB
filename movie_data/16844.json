Homeless, Terry lives in a camper on the property of fellow veteran Javier, otherwise deserted except for shepherd dog Duke, whom he adopted while still convalescing at home, and becomes a handyman. After ten years his world collapses again when Duke needs vet care he can't afford, so he leaves his buddy with a plea note at the animal clinic, presumably to be put down.
