Harry, who thinks he speaks fluent hamster (but, in fact, misunderstands every squeak that comes out of his little pal's mouth), incorrectly thinks Abu's dying wish is a trip to Blackpool. With Nan making three, the trio embark on a road trip to the seaside town. Unbeknownst to them, the vet is actually the dirty rotten henchman of Harry's evil twin brother Otto (Matt Lucas), who was raised separately by Alsatians. Addicted to hula hoops and fuelled by revenge, Otto's nefarious plot is to kidnap Abu and make him the centerpiece of the plastinated hamster world he's creating in his evil lair.
