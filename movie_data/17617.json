He's tough, with a very short fuse, and has a habit of spitting on people who give him trouble, but he's also nice, very shy and simple-minded and he seems to be suffering from a brain injury caused by the years of fighting that's getting worse. He's in love with a nice cute no-nonsense girl Ruby, who owns and runs a small amusement park at the local beach, but he cannot get himself to tell her that. He's also getting too old to keep on boxing, but it's the only thing he knows how to do, even though it will probably kill him.
