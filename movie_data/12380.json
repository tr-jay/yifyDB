Each of the five women, different from the other in temperament and capability, is the emotional support system, although at times reluctantly, for each other, with the eldest assuming the role of a \"somewhat meddling\" overseer.

Nevertheless, life goes on for the five sisters, although undeniably affected by the presence of the two men, they continue to cope as a close-knit unit until something happens that disrupts the fabric of that cohesiveness beyond repair.", "description_full": "A young boy tells the story of growing up in a fatherless home with his unmarried mother and four spinster aunts in 1930's Ireland.
