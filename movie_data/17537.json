In an effort to make some quick money and marry Diana, Blake becomes a retainer for gangster Joe Grant while the upright (and uptight) Sawyer becomes a medical examiner in the district attorney's office. Grant is involved in a murder and forces Blake to remove an identifying scar, thereby proving that all gangsters should keep a doctor on retainment. But Blake has a change of heart and shows up at Grant's trial, spills the beans and Grant is convicted.
