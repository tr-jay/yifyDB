There, she discovers her father's final work: a mysterious music score marked with strange symbols. With the help of Charles Vernais (Simon Abkarian), her agent and manager, she deciphers the symbols and, little by little, starts to unlock secrets concerning her father's past, setting in motion the mechanisms of a somber plan imagined since the day she was born.
