As a result, bent on bringing order and discipline back to his crime-ridden school, the new principal, Dr Miles Langford, agrees to take part in an ambitious government initiative by having three former military cyborgs as undercover android educators. For the fresh-out-of-prison ex-gang member, Cody Culp, this is a golden opportunity to start afresh and get his life back on track; however, his zero-tolerance cybernetic instructors only believe in punishment. Back in 1984, the teachers were afraid of the pupils, in Class of 1984 (1982). Now, in 1999, it's the other way round.
