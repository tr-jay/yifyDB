As Bob the Tomato and the kids settle in to wait for a tow truck to help get their van back on the road, the \"Pirates Who Don't Do Anything\" share a little story about a guy named Jonah. Jonah was kind of like a mailman except his messages came straight from God. Jonah loves his job, until the day comes when he has to deliver a message to the people of Nineveh. Instead of carrying out his mission, Jonah turns and sets sail in the opposite direction onboard a pirate ship. Soon Jonah embarks on an adventure that leads him into the belly of a whale, and to the heart of Nineveh for a hilarious showdown.", "description_full": "When the singing Veggies encounter some car trouble, they're stranded at old, rundown seafood joint where nothing is quite as it seems.
