He is mired in the lower depths of adolescence; his skin is breaking out, he feels incredibly awkward, and he can't get women off his mind. While his older brother tries to help by arranging him to lose his virginity to a cooperative neighborhood woman, he is still mortified after the big seduction that he hasn't actually kissed a girl, and he and his pals Andy and Rony struggle to make sense of the fair sex. While they occasionally visit a neighborhood brothel where the working girls offer various forms of sympathy, they'd rather be spending time with the girls from their school, and Rafa sets his sights on Nicole, who is pretty enough that nearly everyone is convinced he doesn't stand a chance with her.", "description_full": "Rafa, a teenage boy who is just edging into his teens tries to unravel the mysteries of love and sex in this coming-of-age story.
