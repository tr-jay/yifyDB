On the other hand, her traditional bread-baker fianc\u00e9, Masetto, has other plans, insisting on deflowering his beloved chosen one not earlier than the night of their wedding. However, Lola is impatient, and above all, unsatisfied--and under those circumstances--she never misses an opportunity to flaunt her smooth, well-rounded derri\u00e8re, while riding her bicycle. Now, wild curiosity turns into bottled-up sexuality, inflaming Lola's fervent desires. Without a doubt, the untamed Lola knows what she wants, and she wants it now.
