Signature house styles are creations that happen behind closed doors and in the miles of cellars beneath Champagne. Pull back the curtain and see how the people of a cold, tough land with a grim history triumph in producing the drink of joy, seduction and celebration.", "description_full": "Renowned wine importer Martine Saunier returns as our guide in the second installment in a trilogy of wine films.
