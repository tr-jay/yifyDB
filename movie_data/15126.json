A few weeks after the acquittal, Elise Laird, the judge's wife, encounters a burglar and kills him in their home.

Elise claims that her husband is trying to kill her due to her connection to Savitch, and the judge claims he knows nothing. After Elise is kidnapped by a strange man, she disappears and it looks as though she has been thrown into the river, but she mysteriously shows up at Hatcher's home after the judge identifies a dead body as hers.
