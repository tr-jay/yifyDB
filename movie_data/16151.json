His stately ship is as good as ready for her maiden voyage and all Sharky needs is a compass and a real crew. Little did he know that both will have their price - Accidently Sharky has quite a bit of stowaway on board: MICKEY, who's wrongfully taken as a thief, and BONNIE, the ADMIRAL'S daughter, who ran away from her father.
