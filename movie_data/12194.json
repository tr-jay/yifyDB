One weekend, they turn their sights on a couple of naive newlyweds, Betsy and Eddie and bet on whether or not they can seduce the two. Their small get together at their luxury Riviera villa turns into a night of secrets, seduction, and sexual discovery like no other. Elvira and Jack depict bisexuality perfectly as a swingers couple, having sex with each other as well as members of the same sex. When it comes to our naive newlyweds, Eddie is clearly a closeted homosexual and Betsy undoubtedly wants to be more than friends with Elvira while still maintaining an interest for the men in her life. Jack and Elvira allow these young partners to achieve a sexual liberation - regardless of sexuality.", "description_full": "A happily married bisexual swinging couple, Jack and Elvira who spend their days lounging around the villa making bets and having sex.
