But just as he readies himself for a simpler life with the woman he loves (Ana de Armas), Sergio takes one last assignment - in Baghdad, newly plunged into chaos following the US invasion. The assignment is meant to be brief, until a bomb blast causes the walls of the UN headquarters to come literally crashing down upon him, setting into motion a gripping life-or-death struggle.
