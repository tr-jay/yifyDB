Frequently home alone, Pim often spends time at a neighbor's house where another single mom and her two teenage children accept him matter-of-factly. As Pim is about to turn 15, he and neighbor boy Gino become each other's friend-with-benefits, entering a period of sexual awakening together. Life, however, is all about change, and while Gino (a couple years older) is ready to move on and move out, Pim is not, leaving Pim behind to carry on with his continuing crush for Gino (while Gino's sister Sabrina develops an unrequited crush for Pim).", "description_full": "Pim, the emotionally abandoned and affection-starved young gay son of a small seaside town's resident floozy, grows up dreaming intensely of a loving father who will someday come for him, but never does.
