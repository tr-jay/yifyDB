It was created in the vein of old slashers, stylized as though the movie had been released in the 80's, alongside the Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees films of the time. Featuring all the components that classic horror fans love, we run the horror gamut; A girl in the woods, a girl in the shower, the babysitter, the girl with her boyfriend, the drunken detective, the inept police department, the creepy old man with a warning, the one character who seems to know too much, and an iconic killer in a mask, The Ripper. Topping it off with an 80's soundtrack, this one will leave you feeling nostalgic.", "description_full": "Blood Slaughter Massacre is an homage to 80's slasher movies.
