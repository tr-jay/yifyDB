Marlowe. Mitchum. No one is a saint in the City of Angels. The immortal Robert Mitchum stars as Raymond Chandler's legendary detective Philip Marlowe in the neo-noir mystery Farewell, My Lovely. The hard-boiled Marlowe's latest cases (one, a search for an ex-convict''s lost love, and the other, the murder of a client) take on an even more sinister turn when they begin to connect, leading the private eye deeper and deeper into the seamy underbelly of 1940s Los Angeles. As the stakes are raised and the body count swells, it looks like Marlowe might be next on the list to take the big sleep. Also featuring Charlotte Rampling, Sylvia Miles, Harry Dean Stanton, and Sylvester Stallone in an early role, Farewell, My Lovely is an unflinching take on Chandler's pulpy novel and a mystery film as powerful and complex as its leading man.", "description_full": "Murder.
