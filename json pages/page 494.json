When Kristal had difficulty booking country bands in his club on the Bowery he opened his doors to other kinds of rock music. Kristal had one demand of the acts he booked; they could only play original music. No top 40's, no covers. It was the credo he lived by, support the artist at whatever the cost. Hilly Kristal ironically became known as the godfather of punk giving a chance to such bands as Blondie, Television, Ramones, Talking Heads, Dead Boys and The Police.", "yt_trailer_code": "scW0Dqims9c", "language": "en", "mpa_rating": "R", "background_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/cbgb_2013/background.jpg", "background_image_original": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/cbgb_2013/background.jpg", "small_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/cbgb_2013/small-cover.jpg", "medium_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/cbgb_2013/medium-cover.jpg", "large_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/cbgb_2013/large-cover.jpg", "state": "ok", "torrents": [{"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/5E1D99063D00AF09A1689DD436783C0DC6572522", "hash": "5E1D99063D00AF09A1689DD436783C0DC6572522", "quality": "720p", "type": "bluray", "seeds": 4, "peers": 0, "size": "942.67 MB", "size_bytes": 988461138, "date_uploaded": "2020-04-07 14:06:29", "date_uploaded_unix": 1586261189}, {"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/8E54F7D970AC58F809779A97ABF9D869D9E1BA0F", "hash": "8E54F7D970AC58F809779A97ABF9D869D9E1BA0F", "quality": "1080p", "type": "bluray", "seeds": 11, "peers": 1, "size": "1.89 GB", "size_bytes": 2029372047, "date_uploaded": "2020-04-07 16:15:34", "date_uploaded_unix": 1586268934}], "date_uploaded": "2020-04-07 14:06:29", "date_uploaded_unix": 1586261189}, {"id": 16520, "url": "https://yts.mx/movies/sulphur-and-white-2020", "imdb_code": "tt7334158", "title": "Sulphur and White", "title_english": "Sulphur and White", "title_long": "Sulphur and White (2020)", "slug": "sulphur-and-white-2020", "year": 2020, "rating": 5.1, "runtime": 121, "genres": ["Drama"], "summary": "David is a successful city trader in London who is relentlessly focused on work.
