Desert Dancer is a classic hero story about brave young people risking their lives to rebel against their government and fight for their dreams. Set in Iran, where it is currently forbidden to dance, the story follows Afshin Ghaffarian and his friends who despite the dangers form an underground dance company where, via hacking into YouTube, they learn from the very best - Michael Jackson, Pina Bausch, Gene Kelly and Rudolf Nureyev. Reveling in the freedom of expression that dance gives them, they set upon putting on a performance deep in the desert, away from the watchful eyes of the military police.", "yt_trailer_code": "x__YXEn6854", "language": "en", "mpa_rating": "PG-13", "background_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/desert_dancer_2014/background.jpg", "background_image_original": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/desert_dancer_2014/background.jpg", "small_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/desert_dancer_2014/small-cover.jpg", "medium_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/desert_dancer_2014/medium-cover.jpg", "large_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/desert_dancer_2014/large-cover.jpg", "state": "ok", "torrents": [{"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/B2EEC95643B7E3A10354584EBDD994094FC60E0C", "hash": "B2EEC95643B7E3A10354584EBDD994094FC60E0C", "quality": "720p", "type": "bluray", "seeds": 4, "peers": 1, "size": "919.8 MB", "size_bytes": 964480205, "date_uploaded": "2019-08-30 07:06:20", "date_uploaded_unix": 1567141580}, {"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/91364F5FCA66C7FD09BBE6FF1189DA87B3D95DF8", "hash": "91364F5FCA66C7FD09BBE6FF1189DA87B3D95DF8", "quality": "1080p", "type": "bluray", "seeds": 0, "peers": 1, "size": "1.64 GB", "size_bytes": 1760936591, "date_uploaded": "2019-08-30 08:39:04", "date_uploaded_unix": 1567147144}], "date_uploaded": "2019-08-30 07:06:20", "date_uploaded_unix": 1567141580}, {"id": 13441, "url": "https://yts.mx/movies/blunt-force-trauma-2015", "imdb_code": "tt3520290", "title": "Blunt Force Trauma", "title_english": "Blunt Force Trauma", "title_long": "Blunt Force Trauma (2015)", "slug": "blunt-force-trauma-2015", "year": 2015, "rating": 4.6, "runtime": 97, "genres": ["Action"], "summary": "Follows the journey of John and Colt, gunfighters and sometimes lovers, on parallel but very different journeys through an underground dueling culture.", "description_full": "Follows the journey of John and Colt, gunfighters and sometimes lovers, on parallel but very different journeys through an underground dueling culture.", "synopsis": "Follows the journey of John and Colt, gunfighters and sometimes lovers, on parallel but very different journeys through an underground dueling culture.", "yt_trailer_code": "nJnXJ_THuvg", "language": "en", "mpa_rating": "", "background_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/blunt_force_trauma_2015/background.jpg", "background_image_original": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/blunt_force_trauma_2015/background.jpg", "small_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/blunt_force_trauma_2015/small-cover.jpg", "medium_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/blunt_force_trauma_2015/medium-cover.jpg", "large_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/blunt_force_trauma_2015/large-cover.jpg", "state": "ok", "torrents": [{"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/481BAA12DBE6FB9169FD73ED7C9428213F6E68B0", "hash": "481BAA12DBE6FB9169FD73ED7C9428213F6E68B0", "quality": "720p", "type": "bluray", "seeds": 3, "peers": 4, "size": "847.18 MB", "size_bytes": 888332616, "date_uploaded": "2019-08-30 04:26:03", "date_uploaded_unix": 1567131963}, {"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/B1B9222F922BD0673920D5DD299ED04ED2A36FB0", "hash": "B1B9222F922BD0673920D5DD299ED04ED2A36FB0", "quality": "1080p", "type": "bluray", "seeds": 1, "peers": 3, "size": "1.51 GB", "size_bytes": 1621350154, "date_uploaded": "2019-08-30 06:15:15", "date_uploaded_unix": 1567138515}], "date_uploaded": "2019-08-30 04:26:03", "date_uploaded_unix": 1567131963}, {"id": 13440, "url": "https://yts.mx/movies/santa-girl-2019", "imdb_code": "tt7315570", "title": "Santa Girl", "title_english": "Santa Girl", "title_long": "Santa Girl (2019)", "slug": "santa-girl-2019", "year": 2019, "rating": 5, "runtime": 90, "genres": ["Action", "Comedy", "Romance"], "summary": "The only daughter of Santa Claus (Barry Bostwick \"Spin City\") wants to experience the \"real world\" before she must marry the son of Jack Frost and take over the family business.
