Burroughs: The Movie is the first and only feature length documentary to be made with and about Burroughs. The film was directed by the late Howard Brookner. It was begun in 1978 as Brookner's senior thesis at NYU film school and then expanded into a feature which was completed 5 years later in 1983. Sound was recorded by Jim Jarmusch and the film was shot by Tom DiCillo, fellow NYU classmates and both very close friends of Brookner's.", "yt_trailer_code": "oUYBCK1h3A0", "language": "en", "mpa_rating": "", "background_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/burroughs_the_movie_1983/background.jpg", "background_image_original": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/burroughs_the_movie_1983/background.jpg", "small_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/burroughs_the_movie_1983/small-cover.jpg", "medium_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/burroughs_the_movie_1983/medium-cover.jpg", "large_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/burroughs_the_movie_1983/large-cover.jpg", "state": "ok", "torrents": [{"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/6F692A3E63296DD9FAF84BA7CFF899F2E898C0CD", "hash": "6F692A3E63296DD9FAF84BA7CFF899F2E898C0CD", "quality": "720p", "type": "bluray", "seeds": 1, "peers": 1, "size": "632.92 MB", "size_bytes": 663664722, "date_uploaded": "2016-03-02 00:40:32", "date_uploaded_unix": 1456875632}, {"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/3220DE822DD8E652BD174F1157028843C4CD2C13", "hash": "3220DE822DD8E652BD174F1157028843C4CD2C13", "quality": "1080p", "type": "bluray", "seeds": 7, "peers": 3, "size": "1.34 GB", "size_bytes": 1438814044, "date_uploaded": "2016-03-02 03:58:28", "date_uploaded_unix": 1456887508}], "date_uploaded": "2016-03-02 00:40:32", "date_uploaded_unix": 1456875632}, {"id": 5193, "url": "https://yts.mx/movies/fixed-bayonets-1951", "imdb_code": "tt0043540", "title": "Fixed Bayonets!", "title_english": "Fixed Bayonets!", "title_long": "Fixed Bayonets!
