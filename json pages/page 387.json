Byron De La Beckwith was convicted on February 5, 1994, after having remained a free man for much of the 30 years after the murder, giving justice for Medgar Evers' family.", "yt_trailer_code": "8KvsMfiSWYg", "language": "en", "mpa_rating": "PG-13", "background_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/ghosts_of_mississippi_1996/background.jpg", "background_image_original": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/ghosts_of_mississippi_1996/background.jpg", "small_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/ghosts_of_mississippi_1996/small-cover.jpg", "medium_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/ghosts_of_mississippi_1996/medium-cover.jpg", "large_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/ghosts_of_mississippi_1996/large-cover.jpg", "state": "ok", "torrents": [{"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/5DB9C3FC838665BDA26C8AC230A15CBC807C9F5D", "hash": "5DB9C3FC838665BDA26C8AC230A15CBC807C9F5D", "quality": "720p", "type": "web", "seeds": 5, "peers": 2, "size": "1.17 GB", "size_bytes": 1256277934, "date_uploaded": "2020-06-29 14:37:37", "date_uploaded_unix": 1593434257}, {"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/C00D657E8F85CF5BCFED667D2A0AF34E2B570F1F", "hash": "C00D657E8F85CF5BCFED667D2A0AF34E2B570F1F", "quality": "1080p", "type": "web", "seeds": 0, "peers": 73, "size": "2.17 GB", "size_bytes": 2330019758, "date_uploaded": "2020-06-29 18:07:48", "date_uploaded_unix": 1593446868}], "date_uploaded": "2020-06-29 14:37:37", "date_uploaded_unix": 1593434257}, {"id": 18733, "url": "https://yts.mx/movies/take-it-with-you-2012", "imdb_code": "tt2044867", "title": "Take It with You", "title_english": "Take It with You", "title_long": "Take It with You (2012)", "slug": "take-it-with-you-2012", "year": 2012, "rating": 6.6, "runtime": 64, "genres": ["Adventure", "Biography", "Documentary"], "summary": "In April 2009, Bryce Lemon and his sister Alyssa departed on what they hoped would be a spiritual journey around the world.
