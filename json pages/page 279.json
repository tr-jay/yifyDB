Chronicling the highs and lows of Vietnam's most notorious female gangsters, this is a woman's journey as she breaks the glass ceiling in a man's word, albeit, a much darker and dangerous existence. Shaded by the influence and lessons of the men in her life: Nhan her childhood sweetheart, her great unrequited love; Hung fifty shades of empty but a great physical attraction; Tung the man of her dreams, husband, lover and friend; and Tan - the gentle man who promises a simpler life. Each of the men in her life contribute to Dieu's great success (and failures) as she climbs to the top of Vietnam's gangster underworld.", "yt_trailer_code": "", "language": "vi", "mpa_rating": "", "background_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/rise_2014/background.jpg", "background_image_original": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/rise_2014/background.jpg", "small_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/rise_2014/small-cover.jpg", "medium_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/rise_2014/medium-cover.jpg", "large_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/rise_2014/large-cover.jpg", "state": "ok", "torrents": [{"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/F3206650DC11808B45C8A7B0419E84C54FB7773C", "hash": "F3206650DC11808B45C8A7B0419E84C54FB7773C", "quality": "720p", "type": "web", "seeds": 3, "peers": 1, "size": "852.43 MB", "size_bytes": 893837640, "date_uploaded": "2020-09-07 08:57:24", "date_uploaded_unix": 1599461844}, {"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/B487C26D626984D82901B413F5756253CD7DD820", "hash": "B487C26D626984D82901B413F5756253CD7DD820", "quality": "1080p", "type": "web", "seeds": 3, "peers": 0, "size": "1.71 GB", "size_bytes": 1836098519, "date_uploaded": "2020-09-07 10:57:05", "date_uploaded_unix": 1599469025}], "date_uploaded": "2020-09-07 08:57:24", "date_uploaded_unix": 1599461844}, {"id": 20970, "url": "https://yts.mx/movies/the-happiness-of-a-mother-2019", "imdb_code": "tt9822862", "title": "The Happiness of a Mother", "title_english": "The Happiness of a Mother", "title_long": "The Happiness of a Mother (2019)", "slug": "the-happiness-of-a-mother-2019", "year": 2019, "rating": 4.7, "runtime": 93, "genres": ["Action", "Drama", "Family"], "summary": "A mother who is diagnosed with terminal cancer, prepares to leave her family and her little son who is diagnosed with Autism.", "description_full": "A mother who is diagnosed with terminal cancer, prepares to leave her family and her little son who is diagnosed with Autism.", "synopsis": "A mother who is diagnosed with terminal cancer, prepares to leave her family and her little son who is diagnosed with Autism.", "yt_trailer_code": "", "language": "vi", "mpa_rating": "", "background_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_happiness_of_a_mother_2019/background.jpg", "background_image_original": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_happiness_of_a_mother_2019/background.jpg", "small_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_happiness_of_a_mother_2019/small-cover.jpg", "medium_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_happiness_of_a_mother_2019/medium-cover.jpg", "large_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_happiness_of_a_mother_2019/large-cover.jpg", "state": "ok", "torrents": [{"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/78731B0948E672C4699F04E79D664F0604BE4D3C", "hash": "78731B0948E672C4699F04E79D664F0604BE4D3C", "quality": "720p", "type": "web", "seeds": 0, "peers": 0, "size": "792.75 MB", "size_bytes": 831258624, "date_uploaded": "2020-09-07 00:11:40", "date_uploaded_unix": 1599430300}, {"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/CA409689E1F1A7198732CDC69911476F0C2CA29B", "hash": "CA409689E1F1A7198732CDC69911476F0C2CA29B", "quality": "1080p", "type": "web", "seeds": 1, "peers": 3, "size": "1.59 GB", "size_bytes": 1707249500, "date_uploaded": "2020-09-07 01:39:19", "date_uploaded_unix": 1599435559}], "date_uploaded": "2020-09-07 00:11:40", "date_uploaded_unix": 1599430300}, {"id": 20971, "url": "https://yts.mx/movies/super-star-super-silly-2018", "imdb_code": "tt8010518", "title": "Super Star Super Silly", "title_english": "Super Star Super Silly", "title_long": "Super Star Super Silly (2018)", "slug": "super-star-super-silly-2018", "year": 2018, "rating": 4.9, "runtime": 90, "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "summary": "Story about twins: The Son is a superstar and The Tung is a farmer.
