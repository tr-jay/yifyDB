Anthony Dean Giffrey's voice is controlled and has no problem being heard, he brings a boyishness and elegance which is impressive for one with so imposing a figure and he is very emotive, I actually prefer his Jimmy to his Peter Grimes personally. Robert Worle brings a lot of colour and character to Fatty and Donnie Ray Albert is a menacing Moses. All secondary roles are well taken. Overall, a mostly very good production though a lot of it from a musical standpoint, of the three DVD productions seen this is second to the Met's. 8/10 Bethany Cox", "yt_trailer_code": "", "language": "", "mpa_rating": "", "background_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/great_performances_rise_and_fall_of_the_city_of_mahagonny_2007/background.jpg", "background_image_original": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/great_performances_rise_and_fall_of_the_city_of_mahagonny_2007/background.jpg", "small_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/great_performances_rise_and_fall_of_the_city_of_mahagonny_2007/small-cover.jpg", "medium_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/great_performances_rise_and_fall_of_the_city_of_mahagonny_2007/medium-cover.jpg", "large_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/great_performances_rise_and_fall_of_the_city_of_mahagonny_2007/large-cover.jpg", "state": "ok", "torrents": [{"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/060917BB4E0B2A7E31EA0C29517FAC2076CEE51A", "hash": "060917BB4E0B2A7E31EA0C29517FAC2076CEE51A", "quality": "720p", "type": "web", "seeds": 2, "peers": 0, "size": "1.24 GB", "size_bytes": 1331439862, "date_uploaded": "2020-07-18 04:56:56", "date_uploaded_unix": 1595041016}, {"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/F9CE8E999515575DEADF4313264AC8A63E4B4290", "hash": "F9CE8E999515575DEADF4313264AC8A63E4B4290", "quality": "1080p", "type": "web", "seeds": 0, "peers": 6, "size": "2.29 GB", "size_bytes": 2458868777, "date_uploaded": "2020-07-18 08:55:41", "date_uploaded_unix": 1595055341}], "date_uploaded": "2020-07-18 04:56:56", "date_uploaded_unix": 1595041016}, {"id": 19366, "url": "https://yts.mx/movies/luciano-mellera-infantiloide-2018", "imdb_code": "tt7607400", "title": "Luciano Mellera: Infantiloide", "title_english": "Luciano Mellera: Infantiloide", "title_long": "Luciano Mellera: Infantiloide (2018)", "slug": "luciano-mellera-infantiloide-2018", "year": 2018, "rating": 8.3, "runtime": 66, "genres": ["Action", "Comedy"], "summary": "Argentina's Luciano Mellera emphasizes the humorous and fantastical aspects of childhood through comedic impersonations and insights on daily life.", "description_full": "Argentina's Luciano Mellera emphasizes the humorous and fantastical aspects of childhood through comedic impersonations and insights on daily life.", "synopsis": "Argentina's Luciano Mellera emphasizes the humorous and fantastical aspects of childhood through comedic impersonations and insights on daily life.", "yt_trailer_code": "", "language": "es", "mpa_rating": "", "background_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/luciano_mellera_infantiloide_2018/background.jpg", "background_image_original": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/luciano_mellera_infantiloide_2018/background.jpg", "small_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/luciano_mellera_infantiloide_2018/small-cover.jpg", "medium_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/luciano_mellera_infantiloide_2018/medium-cover.jpg", "large_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/luciano_mellera_infantiloide_2018/large-cover.jpg", "state": "ok", "torrents": [{"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/EDE6B5B69411C5574DD76E40CA548ED6CD1380F0", "hash": "EDE6B5B69411C5574DD76E40CA548ED6CD1380F0", "quality": "720p", "type": "web", "seeds": 1, "peers": 2, "size": "606.96 MB", "size_bytes": 636443689, "date_uploaded": "2020-07-17 14:35:02", "date_uploaded_unix": 1594989302}, {"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/5DB28F684899A2A902DC05A982184FA76099A801", "hash": "5DB28F684899A2A902DC05A982184FA76099A801", "quality": "1080p", "type": "web", "seeds": 2, "peers": 1, "size": "1.22 GB", "size_bytes": 1309965025, "date_uploaded": "2020-07-17 15:55:46", "date_uploaded_unix": 1594994146}], "date_uploaded": "2020-07-17 14:35:02", "date_uploaded_unix": 1594989302}, {"id": 19365, "url": "https://yts.mx/movies/pizza-beer-and-cigarettes-1998", "imdb_code": "tt0145393", "title": "Pizza, Beer, and Cigarettes", "title_english": "Pizza, Beer, and Cigarettes", "title_long": "Pizza, Beer, and Cigarettes (1998)", "slug": "pizza-beer-and-cigarettes-1998", "year": 1998, "rating": 7.1, "runtime": 92, "genres": ["Action", "Crime", "Drama"], "summary": "A couple of friends work for a taxi driver to rob his passengers, but they feel like they're getting ripped off.
