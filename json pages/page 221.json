And in the process all that has really happened is that I've gotten older and still haven't pursued my dream. After watching Wamego last night, I've decided it is now or never.I wish there were more to the documentary, like steps and such, but somehow I'm going to figure out how to move forward pursuing my dream as determinedly as the Baldersons pursued theirs.You see, I think the real message of Wamego isn't about making an independent film. It's about determination... utter and pure dogged determination. It's about refusing to accept the premise that \"You can't...\" It's about figuring out a way, no matter what the obstacles are. I don't know this family, but my friend does, and he tells me they are pretty genuinely fond of each other.
