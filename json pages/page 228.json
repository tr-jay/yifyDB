It was very difficult to focus on and I ended up needing to re-watch sections because I found myself zoning out and not paying attention. It isn't that I was trying to find fault with the film, but more that I struggled to find something in the film that would actually engage me.While the narrator is easy to understand (and very clearly Canadian, with that accent!), he speaks in a very monotone voice. He tells little anecdotes about his life as a Canadian citizen during the different political climates that each President-Prime Minister relationship created, and while these stories are clearly meant to give the audience something to relate to, I found them distracting and not at all entertaining.The film explains the relationship between many sets of Presidents and Prime Ministers over the course of many years, and explains how each relationship set the tone for the rest of American and Canadian citizens to follow. There were several instances in which the narrator emphasizes the idea that Americans believe that they will one day absorb Canada, and that Canada is basically America already- this threw me off, because it seemed very anti-Canadian in a film that is obviously made for Canadians. But as the film progresses, this sentiment becomes more and more anti-American, and is portrayed more as a joke- \"Well, if Canada doesn't work out, I can always move to America!\" I also feel that much of the film was spent talking about the friendly relationships between American and Canadian leaders, with only a quick mention of how antagonistic Reagan and Mulroney were towards each other. I think the film may have been more effective if this antagonism were emphasized and explained more, as it is such a drastic contrast to previous President-Prime Minister relationships- in particular, the close friendship of FDR and King.In spite of my complaints and what I view as the film's shortcomings, I believe it was a very informational piece.

I think the film may have been more effective if this antagonism were emphasized and explained more, as it is such a drastic contrast to previous President-Prime Minister relationships- in particular, the close friendship of FDR and King.In spite of my complaints and what I view as the film's shortcomings, I believe it was a very informational piece. I found it difficult to learn from, but I do believe that it is simply a difference in my learning style and the film's delivery of information. For any other individual, I'm sure that this would be a great film to learn from, if a bit on the dull side.", "yt_trailer_code": "", "language": "en", "mpa_rating": "", "background_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/in_bed_with_an_elephant_1986/background.jpg", "background_image_original": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/in_bed_with_an_elephant_1986/background.jpg", "small_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/in_bed_with_an_elephant_1986/small-cover.jpg", "medium_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/in_bed_with_an_elephant_1986/medium-cover.jpg", "large_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/in_bed_with_an_elephant_1986/large-cover.jpg", "state": "ok", "torrents": [{"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/5FE889DA8719D9F8AEFB3450BB83271EC72EA592", "hash": "5FE889DA8719D9F8AEFB3450BB83271EC72EA592", "quality": "720p", "type": "web", "seeds": 0, "peers": 1, "size": "550.16 MB", "size_bytes": 576884572, "date_uploaded": "2020-10-11 09:53:08", "date_uploaded_unix": 1602402788}, {"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/CC922229FB38FE0072D4B20152330ED5D8555088", "hash": "CC922229FB38FE0072D4B20152330ED5D8555088", "quality": "1080p", "type": "web", "seeds": 3, "peers": 1, "size": "1020.68 MB", "size_bytes": 1070260552, "date_uploaded": "2020-10-11 10:54:35", "date_uploaded_unix": 1602406475}], "date_uploaded": "2020-10-11 09:53:08", "date_uploaded_unix": 1602402788}, {"id": 22027, "url": "https://yts.mx/movies/another-mans-wife-2011", "imdb_code": "tt1753444", "title": "Another Man's Wife", "title_english": "Another Man's Wife", "title_long": "Another Man's Wife (2011)", "slug": "another-mans-wife-2011", "year": 2011, "rating": 4, "runtime": 86, "genres": ["Action", "Drama", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "summary": "Brian Warner takes his workaholic wife Hadley and their teenage brat daughter Skylar to a mountain lodge to mend their bond after a marital separation.
