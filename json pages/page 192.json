Ultimately, \"The Disrupted\" reveals a collective American experience of financial challenge, family resilience, and the quest for the purpose and dignity of work.", "yt_trailer_code": "", "language": "en", "mpa_rating": "", "background_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_disrupted_2020/background.jpg", "background_image_original": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_disrupted_2020/background.jpg", "small_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_disrupted_2020/small-cover.jpg", "medium_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_disrupted_2020/medium-cover.jpg", "large_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_disrupted_2020/large-cover.jpg", "state": "ok", "torrents": [{"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/831EB9B88C827584B18C436CD143821AE75963E5", "hash": "831EB9B88C827584B18C436CD143821AE75963E5", "quality": "720p", "type": "web", "seeds": 4, "peers": 0, "size": "832.34 MB", "size_bytes": 872771748, "date_uploaded": "2020-10-22 23:41:08", "date_uploaded_unix": 1603402868}, {"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/C0CB26169603E88CEE2FBECD775A2077E5AD76D8", "hash": "C0CB26169603E88CEE2FBECD775A2077E5AD76D8", "quality": "1080p", "type": "web", "seeds": 2, "peers": 4, "size": "1.51 GB", "size_bytes": 1621350154, "date_uploaded": "2020-10-23 02:00:19", "date_uploaded_unix": 1603411219}], "date_uploaded": "2020-10-22 23:41:08", "date_uploaded_unix": 1603402868}, {"id": 22743, "url": "https://yts.mx/movies/bruce-springsteens-letter-to-you-2020", "imdb_code": "tt13093506", "title": "Bruce Springsteen's Letter to You", "title_english": "Bruce Springsteen's Letter to You", "title_long": "Bruce Springsteen's Letter to You (2020)", "slug": "bruce-springsteens-letter-to-you-2020", "year": 2020, "rating": 7.4, "runtime": 90, "genres": ["Action", "Biography", "Documentary", "Music"], "summary": "\"Bruce Springsteen's Letter to You\" captures Bruce Springsteen recording his new album \"Letter To You\" live with the full E Street Band, and includes final take performances of 10 originals from the new record.
